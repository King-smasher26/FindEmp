This is a Responsive digital recruitment solution app aimed
at providing a seamless hiring experience for multiple MNCs.

Technology used - 
React+gsap+bootstrap(minimal)

The Working :-

There are basically 3 main components :-

(The data has been taken from a random data generator and API mocking tool - Mockaroo and there are only 100 datasets taken into account but all the functionality is working .... you can cross check it by looking at files "Data.js" and "Logindataset" )
1. Landing page 

2. Login page 
    
Secure login page -> takes input from the user -> matches it with the database array (i.e. Logindataset.js ) -> matches it with user's email and password -> shows "login successful" alert msg.

3. Candidate Search 

We take 3 data points as input for now i.e. gender, country and job profile.

The data of potential Candidates is stored in Data.js 

the data is fetched and map to give a table of potential employees to the company that wants to recruit them. 

------- Now here are some Potential Modifications ------

1. Better filtering of data of potential candidates.
2. Increasing no. of hiring attributes such as "work from home" , "skills knowns" etc.
3.making the Login 2 ways ->(1) for the companies that want to hire employees and (2) for the candidates that are registered

--------- thank you for looking at this webapp --------
